## PalMod-Forks
#### This repository houses three forks of PalMod: PalMod-Lite, PalMod-Extended, and PalMod-Extra.
# PalMod-Extended
PalMod-Extended aims to be a fork of PalMod that adds new features (maybe games) for average and advanced users, while remaining noticably debloated from the original.

-If you're looking for a bare-bones, completely debloated build of PalMod, then head over to the [PalMod-Lite](https://github.com/turtlethug/Palmod-Forks/tree/palmod-lite) branch.

-If you're looking for a big, hulking PalMod build that cuts nothing off the original, while adding tons of features and games, both unnessesary and expirimental, head over to [PalMod-Extra](https://github.com/turtlethug/Palmod-Forks/tree/palmod-extra)
