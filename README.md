PalMod-Extra is a fork of [PalMod](https://github.com/Preppy/PalMod) which aims to implement game support and features that are better off in a hacky fork than cluttering up the original.

The games I've added support for are...
-
- Jojo's Venture _(CPS-III, jojo.zip & clones)_ (Very limited support)
- Escape Kids _(Konami Arcade, esckids.zip & clones)_

The games i'm planning to support are...
-
- Nothing new yet.
